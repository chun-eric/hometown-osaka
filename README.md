## Hometown Osaka

This is a landing page project that was completed as part of Scrimba's Frontend Developer Path in collaboration with Mozilla Developer is to showcase the unique features of my hometown. I am currently based in Osaka so I decided to go a little overboard to showcase what Osaka is all about - Fun, crazy and food! Lots of food! Oh yeah!

<br>

I also added a whole lot of custom features beyond the scope of the project, by adding:

1. Mobile responsivenss
2. Custom CSS Animations and loops
3. Sign Up and Sign in Modal Form
4. Custom generated AI Art to match the overall theme of the project as well as a mascot.
5. Interactive attraction cards
6. Custom side navigation bar on mobile screens

### Reflection

<h5>Context:</h5>
<p>The reason why I chose a specific theme and a character called Shinji Kun was I trying to also redesign the current website that Osaka actually has for its foreign toursim character website called "Osaka Bob".</p>

<p>While looking into Osaka's tourism website, I noticed an opportunity to try something different with their mascot character. I created Shinji Kun as a concept that draws from local culture, hoping to offer a fresh perspective on how we could represent Osaka to visitors.</p>

<h5>Objective:</h5>
<p> Create a beautiful, simple landing page to showcase what is unique and special about your hometown.</p>

<h5>Challenges:</h5>

1. How to keep a consistent design theme?
2. How can people relate more to the character?
3. Is my design and theme consistent with Osaka?
4. How can I improve the website through functionality or design?
5. What features could I add in the future?

<br>

Creating visual harmony turned out to be one of my biggest challenges. While experimenting with colors, fonts, layouts, and artwork pushed me outside my comfort zone, this project really helped me develop new skills and appreciation for design principles.
